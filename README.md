To access the Replit console, follow these steps:

Go to your Replit project page.
Look for a panel at the bottom of the screen. This is the console.
If you don't see the console, look for a button that says 'Console' or a terminal icon, usually at the top of the screen, and click it to open the console.
Once the console is open, you can type commands and see the output.
After accessing the console, you can start the Flask application by typing 'python main.py' and pressing Enter. Let me know if you need any further assistance!

Were you able to access the Replit console and start the Flask application by running 'python main.py'? If you're still having trouble, please let me know, and I'll be happy to provide further assistance.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems you might be viewing the project as a guest or through a shared link, which doesn't provide access to the Replit console. To properly access the project and run the Flask application, please follow these steps:

Make sure you're logged into your Replit account.
Go to the project page on Replit.
Click on the 'Fork' button to create your own copy of the project.
Once forked, you should see the Replit IDE with the console at the bottom.
In the console, type 'python main.py' and press Enter to start the Flask application.
If you're still having trouble, please let me know, and I'll be happy to provide further assistance.

AI
Currently, the Financial Portfolio AI Agent doesn't have a direct configuration option for users. When you register, our system automatically generates synthetic portfolio data for you. This data is then used to showcase the AI agent's capabilities.

Here's how you can interact with your Financial Portfolio AI Agent:

Log in to your account
Navigate to the Financial Portfolio page
View your synthetic portfolio data, including asset names, values, and types
Check the AI-generated analysis of your portfolio, including total value and asset allocation
Explore the interactive pie chart showing your asset allocation
While you can't manually configure your portfolio at the moment, this feature showcases how the AI can analyze and visualize financial data. If you'd like the ability to customize your portfolio in the future, we'd be happy to consider adding this feature. Would you be interested in having more control over your portfolio data?
